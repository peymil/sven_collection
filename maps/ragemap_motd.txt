This map was made in pieces and put together over time by the mapping community of the Official Sven Co-op Forums ( http://www.svencoop.com/forums ). All pieces of the map were made in one hour or less. It was intended to be a small project to see how the map would end up, but became massive overnight. We hope you enjoy what it has to offer.

Kudos to JPolito for fixing the massive amount of errors which come with a map of this magnitude. Though his marbles were lost in the process, he will still remain in our minds.

Very special thanks to Lurid for conceiving the idea and posting the thread in the mapping forums. Without him, this monstrosity would not have been spawned.
