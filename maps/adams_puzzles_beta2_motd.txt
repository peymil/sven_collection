A lot of work goes in to producing a map and it's content. Please do not steal content from this
map without permission from the original creator. If you ask, we will normally say yes. :)


.: Description :.

Well, you must go through a series of rooms. Each room has 4 paths. 1 of them allows you to
continue, the other 3 will kill you. To determine which door allows you to continue you must solve
a small puzzle shown in the room.

You get a special treat at the end! (not just porn)


.: Thanks :.

Thank you for downloading and playing this map, I hope you enjoy playing this map as much as I did
creating it.

If I make this MOTD any longer you'll all get crap "reliable channel overflowed" errors. GG Valve!
